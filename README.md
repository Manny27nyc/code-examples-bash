# DocuSign eSignature Bash Code Examples

### Github repo: code-examples-bash
## Introduction
This repo includes a bash command line application that use curl to demonstrate:

1. **Embedded Signing Ceremony.**
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg001EmbeddedSigning.sh)
   This example sends an envelope, and then uses an embedded signing ceremony for the first signer.
   With embedded signing, the DocuSign signing ceremony is initiated from your website.
1. **Send an envelope with a remote (email) signer and cc recipient.**
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg002SigningViaEmail.sh)
   The envelope includes a pdf, Word, and HTML document.
   Anchor text ([AutoPlace](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/AutoPlace-New-DocuSign-Experience)) is used to position the signing fields in the documents.
1. **List envelopes in the user's account.**
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg003ListEnvelopes.sh)
1. **Get an envelope's basic information.**
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg004EnvelopeInfo.sh)
   The example lists the basic information about an envelope, including its overall status.
1. **List an envelope's recipients**
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg005EnvelopeRecipients.sh)
   Includes current recipient status.

   metadata with the envelope.
   [Source.](./examples/eSignature/eg016SetTabValues.sh)

## Installation

* Download or clone this repository to your workstation `git clone https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-bash`
* Create a [DocuSign developer account](https://account-d.docusign.com/#/username) if you have not yet done so
* Once you have a Docusign account created, make a new [**integration key**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey)
* Add in the following **redirect uri** `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback`
* **Signer name and email:** Remember to try the DocuSign signing ceremony using both a mobile phone and a regular
   email client
* **Carbon Copy name and email:** Do not use the same email address for the CC and the Signer
* [JWT - OPTIONAL] create an RSA keypair on your **integration key** and copy the **private_key** into the file `config/private.key` and save it. Use JWT authentication if you intend to run a system account integration or to impersonate a different user.
* [JWT - CONTINUED] If you intend to use JWT grant authentication, set **IMPERSONATION_USER_GUID** by using your own **user_account_id** found on the same page used to set your [**integration key**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey).
* Copy the file 'config/settings.example.txt' to 'config/settings.txt'
* Fill in your API credentials, Signer name/email and CC name/email using the requirements listed above into 'config/settings.txt'



## OAuth Details

This launcher is a collection of bash scripts, however the OAuth mechanisms are PHP scripts that setup a small HTTP listener on **port 8080** in order to receive the redirect callback from successful authorization with DocuSign servers that include the Authorization code or an access token in the response payload. Please ensure that any other webserver using 8080 are off so that the OAuth mechanism functions properly.

These PHP scripts are integrated into the launcher and hardcode the location for the RSA private key in the case of the JWT PHP scripts.

Do not delete or change the name of the private.key file located in the config directory as this will cause problems with jwt authentication.


## Running the examples
You can see each of the various examples in action by running `bash launcher.sh` and pressing numbers 1 or 2 to login using OAUTH and store an access token. (JWT tokens are good for 1 hour, Authorization Code grant tokens are good for 8 hours.)

On successful login, you will be presented with a menu to run the various examples available.  For example: Press "2", to try eg002SigningViaEmail.

The examples have been tested on Windows using the **Git-Bash** software included with the [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) open source application.

The scripts can also be used with MacOS and Linux systems.

The source files for each example are located in the `/examples` directory.


**Note:** If your DocuSign account has more than one user associated with it, the first user is selected for subsequent API calls.

### Payments code example
To use the payments code example, first create a test payments gateway in your account.
Follow the instructions in the
[PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-bash/blob/master/PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md)
file.

Then add the payment gateway id to the code example file.
